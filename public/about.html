<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ayush, I've been studying informationn technology for three years.
    In order to kick-start my carrer before i graduate, i am looking for a job of a web develpoer.
    I create many projects like Designing websites, developing simple e-shops with the help of some open source 
    content-management systems,and so on. Besides that I am a normal guy who enjoys hiking and spending time with friends,
    while not working or studying, which takes most of my time of course.
